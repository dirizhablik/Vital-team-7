**OXIME**
Today, at home pulse oximeter are often inaccurate on people with darker skin tones which can often lead to 
misdiangnosis and delayed treatment for respiratpry diseases, like hypoxemia which is chronic and life threatening.
**OXIME** allows users to input their own readings through an online **assement** and **camera** which can detect skin tones and 
help determine user's risk of hypoxemia, based on our more accurate model trained on dataset more accurate for pulse oximeter 
readings on more skin tone.

Tech Used: Python, CSS, HTML, Node
