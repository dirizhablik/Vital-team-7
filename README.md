# **OXIME**

## **OVERVIEW**
Pulse oximeters used at home are often inaccurate for people with darker skin tones, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment of respiratory diseases like hypoxemia—a chronic and life-threatening condition.

**OXIME** provides a more accurate assessment by allowing users to input their own readings through an online assessment and camera-based skin tone detection. Our model, trained on a more representative dataset, improves pulse oximeter accuracy across diverse skin tones, helping to better assess the risk of hypoxemia.

### **FEAURES**
5 Minute Personalized Risk Assessment – Users can input pulse oximeter readings alongside a skin tone analysis for a more accurate result.
Skin Tone Detection Camera – A built-in camera feature helps adjust readings based on the Monk skin tone scale which is proven to be more accuarte and inclusive to more skin colors.
Data-Driven Model – Our AI model is trained on a dataset optimized for more accurate pulse oximeter readings across different skin tones.
