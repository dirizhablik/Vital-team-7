       <p className="long-description">
         In 2017, respiratory diseases were the 3rd leading cause of death. Hypoxemia, a condition where the bodyâ€™s oxygen levels are dangerously low, affects many people with respiratory diseases. It demands a well-rounded diagnostic tool because it can lead to lifelong brain damage or death.
         Unfortunately, many countries lack accessible and accurate diagnostic resources. Our goal is to improve the accuracy of the pulse oximeter, an affordable device for measuring blood oxygen levels, especially for those with darker skin tones. Our model, trained on diverse health data, aims to address these accuracy issues and promote healthcare equity.
